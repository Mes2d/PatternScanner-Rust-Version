# PatternScanner Rust Version
This Rust project implements a pattern scanning technique to locate specific function addresses within the ntdll.dll module on Windows. It's based on a previous [C-based pattern scanner](https://github.com/Mes2d/PatternScan-NTDLL-LdrFunctions/tree/main), adapted to Rust for learning and exploration purposes.


### Build Instructions:
To build the project, ensure you have Rust installed. Clone the repository and run:
```
cargo build --release
```

I chose Rust for this project to deepen my understanding of the language's powerful capabilities in system-level programming, despite the initial challenges I faced. This project represents my journey from a C-based pattern scanner to exploring Rust's modern syntax and memory safety features.
